# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

Maria,  the chief data scientist for a city school district is responsible for analyzing information and report the insights that are used for strategic decisions at the school and distric level. In this module, I helped Maria to analyze and prepare some charts to report on student funding and students' standarized test scores in order to discover trends around the schools' performance. These information will be used by the school board and superintendent to define the school budgets and priorities. 

Nevertheless, after the first release of this analysis, the school board warned us that one of the data source (the students_complete.cvs) shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically with the 9th graders scores for Thomas High School. Maria asked me to rerun the overall analysis removing the suspicious data. 

The porpuse of this report is summarize the results of updated analysis and show how these changes affected the overall results reported previously.
